    "# Comparing NYC Mayoral Voting Patterns with Fare Payment Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "As the results of the 2025 NYC Mayoral Election were tallied, [several](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/opinion/mamdani-mayor.html) [articles] and [other] [people] noticed that precints who primarily use transit generally supported Zohran Mamdani, while those that principally drive generally supported Andrew Cuomo. At the same time, [several] [other] [sources] mention a shfiting political landscape away from one dominated by (transit-dependent) Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis I did last year of OMNY versus MetroCard use showed higher OMNY use was higher closer to Manhattan (and uniquely high in Williamsburg). I wanted to see how this distirbution lines up with support for Mamdani and Cuomo."
